I. Board Support Package (BSP)
=========================================

This is the first stable release of the UNOFFICIAL OE-core/Yocto layer
for IGEP boards.

In this first release, we only support basic BSP images that can be used
for booting any IGEP technology based boards.

II. Building the meta-igep BSP layer
=========================================

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding BSP repository.

Having done that, and assuming you downloaded the BSP contents
at the top-level of your yocto build tree, you can build a igep
image by adding the location of the meta-igep layer to
bblayers.conf, e.g.:

        yocto/meta-igep \  

To enable the igep layer, add the igep00x0 MACHINE to local.conf:

  MACHINE ?= "igep00x0"

You should then be able to build a igep image as such:

  $ source oe-init-build-env
  $ bitbake core-image-sato

At the end of a successful build, you should have a image that
you can boot from flash or a micro-SD card.
