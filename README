I. Board Support Package (BSP)
=========================================

This is the UNOFFICIAL Board Support Package for IGEP boards. We
only support basic BSP images that can be used for booting any IGEP
Technology based boards.

II. Building the meta-igep BSP layer
=========================================

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding BSP repository.

Having done that, and assuming you downloaded the BSP contents
at the top-level of your yocto build tree, you can build a igep
image by adding the location of the meta-igep layer to
bblayers.conf, e.g.:

        yocto/meta-igep \  

To enable the igep layer, add the igep00x0 MACHINE to local.conf:

  MACHINE ?= "igep00x0"

You should then be able to build an IGEP image as such:

  $ source oe-init-build-env

and run

  $ bitbake core-image-minimal

or

  $ bitbake core-image-sato

At the end of a successful build, you should have a image that
you can boot from flash or a micro-SD card.
